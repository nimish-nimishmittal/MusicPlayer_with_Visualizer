# MusicPlayer_with_Visualizer
So, this is a Music Player App, created in Python Language and along with that, we even have set a visualizer which visualizes the intensity of the sound produced by the music.

# Libraries used in this project are -
1. tkinter (Which helps in creating a GUI based environment.)
2. fnmatch 
3. os (Which helps in tinkering with the os properties.)
4. pygame (Which helps in generating functionalities.)
5. matplotlib (Which helps in creating a graphical type representation for the visualizer.)
6. librosa

Honestly, I would say that using these libraries was still not easy, i could have reduced the amount of libraries used to create this project.
So, this project is open for all, everyone has the right to suggest changes to this code via Pull Requests.

Hope you'll like this project..!!
